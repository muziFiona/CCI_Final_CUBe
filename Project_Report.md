## Time Management from 28 September - 27 November (9 weeks in total)

### Week 1 (28 Sep - 4 Oct)
Initial concept
<br> Prototype and 3D models created

### Week 2 (5 Oct - 11 Oct)
Deeper research on concept with shapes and media connection to support my project
<br> Investigate into Minimalism and explore the sense of materiality

### Week 3 (12 Oct - 18 Oct)
Look into more supported materials
<br> Ian Bogost and Marshall McLuhan are being studied to develop my idea in the way of games.
<br> Developing the relationship between forms and visuals, and the representation between ourselves and the network that build among us; and intend to express these concept in the way of art and design.

### Week 4 (19 Oct - 25 Oct)
Have rough structure on thesis
<br> basic game object effect is created using Unity3D and will develop base on it through the rest of the time.
<br> Game Building Method:
<br> Using Animation effect with the models I build
<br> Aim to connect all of variation when trigger and generate them randomly.

Look into more tutorial of building with Animation in Unity.
<br> Finding reference about movement in shapes and in games.

### Week 5 (26 Oct - 1 Nov)
Roughly work out the animation effects in Unity
<br> Planning to work on changing the material when animation change

### Week 6 (2 Nov - 8 Nov)
Problems on texture mapping in Unity
<br> Models need to be recreated with the ProBuilder assets within Unity
<br> Animation textures work on 3D models but problems occur when the model is triggered
<br> The animation trigger of 3D models might not be quite right, need to be redefined

### Week 7 (9 Nov - 15 Nov)
Finishing Thesis (have a final structure, section 1 and 2 for concept research and section 3 to present my project)
<br> Trigger problems solved
<br> Project build problem occurs
<br> WEBGL version in Unity3D doesn't support video player which I am not able to present my texture on web
<br> My piece will only be available to download online and play offline

### Week 8 (16 Nov - 22 Nov)
Finishing thesis (refining use of words, correcting mistakes)
<br> Sound creation using Medly (iPad app)
<br> The interactive piece is uploaded onto itch.io and allow people to download
<br> The download link is not yet public but people could get a playtest via private link

### Week 9 (23 Nov - 27 Nov) - The submission
Finishing thesis (refining use of words, correcting mistakes)
<br> Public download link is available: https://muzitua.itch.io/cube
<br> The project is only available on Windows as I failed to build a mac version on Windows laptop
<br> What Next:
<br> Aiming to solve the WEBGL problem, so people could play directly on webpage (strengthen my research concept)
<br> Also building meaning into background music, enrich my piece with all the elements inside the art-game
