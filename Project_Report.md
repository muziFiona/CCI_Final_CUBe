# Project Report

## Time from 28 September - 27 November (8 weeks in total)

### Week 1 (28 Sep - 4 Oct)

Initial concept 
 <br />Prototype and 3D models created

### Week 2 (5 Oct - 11 Oct)

Deepder research on concept with shapes and media connection to support my project
 <br />Investigate into Minimalism and explore the sense of materiality

### Week 3 (12 Oct - 18 Oct)

Look into more supported material
 <br /> Ian Bogost and Marshall McLuhan are being studied to develop my idea in the way of games. 
 <br /> Developing the relationship between forms and visuals, and the representation between ourselves and the network that build among us; and intend to express these concept in the way of art and design.

### Week 4 (19 Oct - 25 Oct)

Have rough structure on thesis
 <br /> basic game object effect is created using Unity3D and will develop base on it through the rest of the time.
 <br /> Game Building Method:
 > Using Animation effect with the models I build
 
 > Aim to connect all of variation when trigger and generate them randomly.
 
 <br /> Look into more tutuial of building with Animation in Unity.
 <br /> Finding reference about movement in shapes and in games.

### Week 5 (26 Oct - 1 Nov)

Roughly work out the animation effects in Unity
<br />Planning to work on changing the material when animation change

### Week 6 (2 Nov - 8 Nov)

Problems on texture mapping in Unity
<br /> Models need to be recreted with the ProBuilder assest within Unity
<br /> Animation textures work on 3D models but problems occur when the model is tiggered
<br /> The animation trigger of 3D models might not be quite right, need to be redefined

### Week 7 (9 Nov - 15 Nov)

Finishing Thesis (have a final structure, section 1 and 2 for concept research and section 3 to present my project)
<br /> Trigger problems solved
<br /> Project build problem occurs
<br /> WEBGL version in Unity3D doesn't support video player which I am not able to present my texture on web
<br /> My piece will only be available to download online and play offline

### Week 8 (16 Nov - 22 Nov)

Finishing thesis (refining use of words, correcting mistakes)
<br /> Sound creation using 
<br /> The interactive piece is uploaded onto itch.io and allow poeple to download
<br /> The download link is not yet public but people could get a playtest via private link

### Week 9 (23 Nov - 27 Nov) - The submission

Finishing thesis (refining use of words, correcting mistakes)
<br /> Public download link is available: https://muzitua.itch.io/cube
<br /> The project is only available on Windows as I failed to build a mac version on Windows laptop

What Next:
<br /> Aiming to solve the WEBGL problem, so people could play directly on webpage (strengthen my research concept)
<br /> Also building meaning into background music, enrich my piece with all the elements inside the art-game
